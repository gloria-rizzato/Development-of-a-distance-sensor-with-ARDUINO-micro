# Development-of-a-distance-sensor-with-ARDUINO-micro
The aim of the project is to measure the distance between the photodiode (sensor) and the LED (input) using ARDUINO micro. Two states of the sensor were implemented: calibration and measurement states since the photodiode was sensitive to ambient light.
